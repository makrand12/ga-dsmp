### Project Overview

 Working on the Melbourne housing data using regularized regression. Each observation is a different house attribute with various features like the number of properties that exist in the suburb, land size, building size, governing council for the area, real estate agent and price of the house etc.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, I have  better understanding of how to build a regularized regression model. In this project,i applied the following concepts.

1) Train-test split
2) Correlation between the features
3) Linear Regression
4) Polynomial Regressor
5) Lasso Regressor
6) Ridge Regressor
7)R^2 Evaluation Metrics
